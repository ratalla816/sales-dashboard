# Sales Pipeline Tracker

A Kanban style board that allows users to manage their sales prospects throughout various stages of the sales cycle. 
The application is built using the template from the KU Bootcamp module 5 activity "Taskmaster-Pro".

## Requirements

* When the user acquires a prospect's contact information they are able to add it to a "card" and edit the contect later.

* The card content is added to persistent storage.

* The contact card can be moved to different positions in the UI according to where the prospect is in the sales cycle. 

* Cards can be added and deleted.
